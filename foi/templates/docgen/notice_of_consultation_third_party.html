The Department has received a request under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act) for access to documents held by the Department.  The request relates to {{ assessment.third_party_request_general_description }}.

  <font size="10pt">
    <b>Why are we writing to you?</b>
  </font>

<b>What is the FOI Act?</b>
  </font>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <font size="10pt">
The FOI Act grants every person a legal right to request access to documents in the possession of agencies of the Australian Government.  When a document is released to someone under FOI, there are no restrictions on what the recipient may do with the document (other than acting lawfully, for example, by not breaching copyright in the document).
  </font>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <font size="10pt">
<b>Are there any limits on disclosure?</b>
  </font>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <font size="10pt">
The FOI Act contains a number of provisions that provide an exemption from release of documents under a range of circumstances.
  </font>
</p>
{% if assessment.include_s47_flag = True %}
<p align="left">
  <font size="10pt">
    <b>Exemptions:</b>
  </font>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <font size="10pt">
The following exemption may apply to the document or documents.
  </font>

<p align="left">
  <font size="10pt">
    <i>section 47:</i>
  </font>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <font size="10pt">
One of these provisions, section 47, includes an exemption from release for documents that contain information relating to the business affairs of an organisation on various grounds.  In order to determine whether this provision applies to these documents, the agency has to establish that disclosure would:
  </font>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <font size="10pt">
a)  reveal trade secrets;
  </font>
</p>
<p align="left">

    <b>Conditional Exemptions:</b>
  </font>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <font size="10pt">
The following "conditional exemptions" may apply to the document or documents.  A conditionally exempt document is not exempt from release unless it would also, on balance, be contrary to the public interest to release it. 
  </font>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <font size="10pt">
Factors favouring access include (but are not limited to):
&#8226; Promoting the objects of the FOI Act (a copy of the objects clause (section 3) is enclosed for your information);
&#8226; Informing debate on a matter of public importance;
&#8226; Promoting effective oversight of public expenditure; and
&#8226; Allowing a person access to his or her own personal information.

To enable the Department to give full consideration to this request, we are seeking your comments on whether the disclosure of the {% if assessment.documents_attached_or_described = 'ATTACHED' %}attached documents{% else %}documents outlined in the attached list{% endif %} would disclose {% if assessment.include_s47_flag = True %}your business affairs information{% elif assessment.include_s47b_flag = True %}State government information{% elif assessment.include_s47f_flag = True %}your personal information{% elif assessment.include_s47g_flag = True %}your business affairs information{% endif %} as outlined in the exemption provision above.

The mere assertion that release of the documents {% if assessment.include_s47_flag = True %}would harm your business or disclose 'commercial-in-confidence' material{% elif assessment.include_s47b_flag = True %}would damage Commonwealth-State relations or disclose confidentially communicated material{% elif assessment.include_s47f_flag = True %}would constitute an unreasonable disclosure of your personal information{% elif assessment.include_s47g_flag = True %}would harm your business or disclose 'commercial-in-confidence' material{% endif %} is not sufficient to sustain exemption of the documents from disclosure under the FOI Act.  Evidence is needed to support the claim.

Section 22 of the FOI Act allows for information within a document to be deleted where it is exempt and for the rest of the document to be released.  In your response please address the question of whether deletion of sensitive information from the documents could eliminate or substantially reduce any objections you might have to the release of the remainder of the documents.  Without strong supporting evidence, global exemption claims over whole documents are unlikely to be successful in the event that the applicant appeals to the Information Commissioner or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

  <font size="10pt">
The department must publish information that has been released to an applicant in response to a freedom of information request, subject to certain exceptions.  This publication is known as a disclosure log.  The disclosure log requirement does not apply to personal information about any person if it would be unreasonable to publish the information nor to information about the business, commercial, financial or professional affairs of any person if publication of that information would be unreasonable.  You might also like to express a view regarding the publication of any information which you consider it would be unreasonable to publish.  Please note that the Department is not required to consult you further on any decision to publish information released to the FOI applicant.  The decision to publish information is not subject to review either by the Department or the Australian Information Commissioner.  It is however, open to any person to make a complaint to the Australian Information Commissioner about how an agency handles an FOI request.
  </font>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <font size="10pt">
You should be aware that the disclosure log facilitates publication to the world at large of information released under FOI to individual applicants.  This reinforces the objective of the FOI Act to promote a pro-disclosure culture across government and to increase recognition that information held by government is a national resource.
